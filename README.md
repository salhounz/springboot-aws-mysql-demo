# Spring Boot, AWS, MySQL Demo 

This project is a robust web application developed using a modern technology stack. It utilizes Java 17 for the core functionality, with Spring Boot providing a powerful foundation. The use of Spring Data JPA, backed by Hibernate, ensures efficient data persistence and management, while MySQL deployed on AWS serves as the relational database system for storing/retrieving data.

The development environment is facilitated by Eclipse STS, with Postman being utilized for API testing and validation.

To ensure high availability and scalability, the application is hosted on AWS (Amazon Web Services). AWS RDS (Relational Database Service) is used for managing the database, guaranteeing data durability and accessibility. AWS Elastic Beanstalk, a fully managed service, deploys and scales the application automatically, simplifying the deployment process and enhancing its overall efficiency.

This project showcases the synergy of these technologies to deliver a robust and scalable web application with advanced features and a user-friendly interface.
